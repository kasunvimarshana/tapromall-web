/**
 * Template Overrides Directory
 * 
 * This directory is for overriding parent theme templates.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 1. Copy the template file from parent theme (/themes/starter/)
 * 2. Place it in this directory
 * 3. Modify as needed
 * 
 * Example:
 * - To override item.php, copy /themes/starter/item.php here
 * - Your modifications will be used instead of parent template
 * 
 * Best Practices:
 * - Only override templates when absolutely necessary
 * - Try to use hooks instead for small changes
 * - Keep templates as simple as possible
 * - Document why you're overriding the template
 *
