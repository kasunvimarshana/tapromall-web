# Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the theme screenshot.

To add a proper screenshot:

1. Create a PNG image with dimensions 880x660 pixels (recommended)
2. Name it `screenshot.png`
3. Place it in this directory (oc-content/themes/starter_child/)
4. Delete this README_SCREENSHOT.txt file

The screenshot will appear in the Osclass admin panel when selecting themes.

Recommended content for screenshot:

- Ensure good contrast and readability

You can use any image editing software like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
